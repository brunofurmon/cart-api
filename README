# Project Assumptions
- In a real environment, carts are usually associated with users, but for simplicity, this API assumes a single cart.
- There will be always an existing Cart, and its initial state is an empty list of products and total price of 0.
- Although not persisted in a Database, a persistence layer is added to the project to simulate the ports and adapters
- The buy 2 get 3 promotion is always applied to the cart. In a real environment, this would be a promotion configuration that would be applied to the cart based on a set of rules and conditions like period, item count and user profile.

- (TODO!) Items in the cart could have same id (or SKU) but different prices. In this case, the promotion would be applied to the cheapest item.
- (TODO!) Better adapter interfaces over the layers
